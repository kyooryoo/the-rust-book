# Functions
Rust uses *snake case* for fn and var names.

## Statements and Expressions
Statements perform action but do not return a avlue.
Expressions evaluate to and return a resulting value.
*;* can convert an expression to a statement.
Use *return* statement or an expression to return sth.

The main fn is a statement, which has no returns.
An assignment action also has no returned value.
Therefore, `x = y = 6` will cause panic in Rust.
