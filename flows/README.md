# Flow Control

## IFELSE
IFELSE in Rust is a statement which returns value.
IF and ELSE should return value in the same type.

## MATCH
Similar to switch but simpler, use `value => statement`
For matching all other values, use *other* or *_*

## LOOP
Similar to while, but can have indicators.
With indicator, we can break from specified loop.

## FOR
Only work with types that can convert to interators.
Default range is exclusive to the last value.
